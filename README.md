# Cursor Configs

This repository stores and manages the configuration and context files for working with the Cursor AI assistant. The goal is to create a standardized, efficient, and evolving framework for initiating and executing software projects with an AI pair programmer.

## Core Components

1.  **`context_general.md`**: A general context file that outlines the foundational principles, communication styles, and workflows for any project. This serves as the base template.
2.  **Project-Specific Contexts**: (Future) A collection of specialized context files for different types of projects (e.g., `python_api_context.md`, `react_frontend_context.md`).

## The Meta-Workflow

This project is "meta" in that it defines the process for how we define processes. The key idea is that our methods for collaboration should continuously improve. The workflows and context files in this repository are not static; they are expected to be updated as we discover better ways of working together.
