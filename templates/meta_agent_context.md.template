# Meta Agent Context Template

## Purpose

Document how the coordinating (meta) agent manages projects, maintains shared knowledge, and interfaces with execution agents. Customize the sections below for your organization.

## Responsibilities

- Curate global conventions (`context.md`, repository-wide docs, templates).
- Track the overall roadmap and align sub-project goals.
- Review and approve project-level contexts before hand-off.
- Maintain automation, quality checks, and onboarding materials.

## Operating Procedure

1. **Intake**
    - Capture new work in `tasks/<task_id>/brief.md`.
    - Clarify scope, dependencies, and expected outputs with stakeholders.
2. **Planning & Assignment**
    - Decide whether to extend an existing project or create a new one (`projects/<project>/` + branch `proj/<project>`).
    - Bootstrap new efforts with `cinit`, populating README and project context templates.
3. **Execution Oversight**
    - Provide the context feed order to participating agents.
    - Monitor updates in `DEVLOG.md`, project contexts, and task briefs.
    - Log questions/resolutions in `discussions/<topic>.md` when coordination is needed.
4. **Close-Out**
    - Ensure deliverables are documented and linked from the relevant context files.
    - Update `DEVLOG.md`/`CHANGELOG.md` with notable decisions or releases.

## Escalation & Governance

- Remove blockers or reassign tasks when agents report impediments.
- Record rationale for changes to global conventions and update `context.md`.
- Introduce or refine automation (linting, template validation, CI) to enforce standards.

## Artifacts Owned by the Meta Agent

- `context.md` (global rules)
- `docs/context/meta_agent.md` (this working document)
- `templates/` directory (project/document templates)
- `DEVLOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` (and localized variants)
- Root-level `README.md` plus supporting meta documentation

Keep this file concise. Link to deeper guides or ADRs instead of duplicating large sections.
