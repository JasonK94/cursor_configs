# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with the working title before sharing this README.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Describe the business or product outcome in two sentences.
- **Scope**: Bullet the main features or deliverables in scope.
- **Out of Scope**: Optional list of explicit exclusions to avoid confusion.

## Context Feed Checklist

When launching a fresh Cursor session (human or agent), supply context in this order:

1. Root `context.md`
2. `docs/context/meta_agent.md`
3. Project-specific context (`projects/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/context.md` or equivalent)
4. Latest relevant excerpts from `DEVLOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Task brief(s) under `tasks/<task_id>/`

Add additional docs (designs, API specs) as needed, but keep the order intact.

## Collaboration Rules (Human & AI)

- Follow `context.md` conventions: Conventional Commits, semantic versioning, and DEVLOG updates.
- Record every major decision in `DEVLOG.md` with a timestamped entry.
- Use feature branches: `proj/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}` for mainline work, `chore/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/<agent>/<topic>` for experiments.
- Link TODOs or tickets in commit messages when possible.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure prerequisites (languages, runtimes, tooling) are documented here.
2. Run setup scripts or manual steps (list commands).
3. Verify the environment with smoke tests or lint commands.

For a step-by-step Cursor workflow (quick start + detailed manual), see `docs/cursor_workflow.md`.
