# Project-Specific Context for `cursor_configs`

## Primary Goal
The goal of this meta-project is to build and maintain a standardized, efficient, and evolving framework for initiating and executing software projects with an AI pair programmer. This framework is managed through a set of version-controlled scripts and templates, primarily centered around the `cinit` command.

## AI Model
Gemini 2.5 Pro (or the latest powerful model available via Cursor)

## References
