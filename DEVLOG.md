# Developer Log (DEVLOG)

Purpose: Capture narrative context, decisions, and reasoning across sessions so future developers and AI agents can quickly regain context.

- Summary: Initialized repo, added context workflow, created installer and init CLI.
- Details:
  - Added `scripts/install.ps1` (idempotent install/update, profile + PATH shim).
  - Added `scripts/init_project.ps1` (interactive project context generation).
  - Added README sections for setup and usage.
- Risks/Notes: Profile loading can differ by host; added PATH shim `cinit.cmd`.
- Next Steps: Add dev history policy to `context_general.md`; refine per-user alias.

- Summary: Implemented full Linux/macOS compatibility for the `cinit` workflow.
- Details:
  - Created parallel shell script implementations for all core logic (`install.sh`, `init_project.sh`). This was chosen over a single complex script for maintainability.
  - The Linux installer (`install.sh`) creates a shim in `~/.local/bin` and adds it to the user's PATH in their `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, which is the standard practice for user-level executables.
  - All documentation (`README.md`, new `multi_os_support.md`) was updated to reflect the cross-platform nature of the tool.
  - Added a section on using Docker for isolated testing environments.
- Next Steps: Test the full installation and execution flow on a real Linux environment (`ssh s1`).
