# Developer Log (DEVLOG)

Purpose: Capture narrative context, decisions, and reasoning across sessions so future developers and AI agents can quickly regain context.

2025-10-20 - AI Agent
- Summary: Initialized repo, added context workflow, created installer and init CLI.
- Details:
  - Added `scripts/install.ps1` (idempotent install/update, profile + PATH shim).
  - Added `scripts/init_project.ps1` (interactive project context generation).
  - Added README sections for setup and usage.
- Risks/Notes: Profile loading can differ by host; added PATH shim `cinit.cmd`.
- Next Steps: Add dev history policy to `context_general.md`; refine per-user alias.

2025-10-20 - AI Agent
- Summary: Implemented full Linux/macOS compatibility for the `cinit` workflow.
- Details:
  - Created parallel shell script implementations for all core logic (`install.sh`, `init_project.sh`). This was chosen over a single complex script for maintainability.
  - The Linux installer (`install.sh`) creates a shim in `~/.local/bin` and adds it to the user's PATH in their `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, which is the standard practice for user-level executables.
  - All documentation (`README.md`, new `multi_os_support.md`) was updated to reflect the cross-platform nature of the tool.
  - Added a section on using Docker for isolated testing environments.
- Next Steps: Test the full installation and execution flow on a real Linux environment (`ssh s1`).

2025-10-21 - AI Agent
- **Summary**: Adopting industry-standard development conventions.
- **Details**:
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and its template to the "Keep a Changelog" format.
  - Standardized date formats in `DEVLOG.md` to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - Added a "Development Conventions" section to the meta `context.md` to enforce Conventional Commits and Semantic Versioning for all future AI work on this project.
- **Next Steps**: Begin final end-to-end testing of the complete `cinit` workflow on a live Linux server.

2025-10-21 - AI Agent
- **Summary**: Preparing for final Linux end-to-end test on server `s1`.
- **Details**:
  - The plan is to perform a full, clean installation and `cinit` execution on the `s1` server.
  - The test will verify that all four context files (`context.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) are correctly generated in the specified test directory (`/data/kjc1/git_repo/cinit_final_test`).
  - The test will be conducted non-interactively by piping pre-defined inputs to the script.
- **Next Steps**: Push all local commits to the remote repository and begin the test.
- **Result**: **SUCCESS**. The end-to-end test on `s1` completed successfully. `ls -l` confirmed that all four context files were created correctly in the target directory. The Linux workflow is now considered stable and verified.
