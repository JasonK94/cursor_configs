# Documentation Structure: Model vs. Project

This document clarifies the distinction between the "model" documents stored in the `cursor_configs` repository and the "project" documents generated and used in your individual project folders. Understanding this separation is key to using this framework effectively.

## 1. Model Documents (in `cursor_configs` repo)

These are the master templates that define the *standard process* for all projects.

-   **Location**: `d:\git_repo\cursor_configs\` (or wherever you cloned it)
-   **Purpose**: To serve as reusable, version-controlled templates. They ensure consistency across all projects.
-   **Examples**:
    -   `context_general.md`: The base context template.
    -   `README.md`: Explains the `cursor_configs` project itself.
    -   `scripts/init_project.ps1`: The script that *uses* a model document to create a project document.
-   **How to Modify**: These files should only be modified when you want to improve the standard process for *all future projects*. Changes are made directly in the `cursor_configs` repository, tracked in `DEVLOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, and then committed.

## 2. Project Documents (in your project folder, e.g., `amazon_scraper\`)

These are the specific, concrete documents that guide the AI for a *single project*.

-   **Location**: Your specific project's root directory (e.g., `d:\git_repo\amazon_scraper\`).
-   **Purpose**: To define the unique goals, scope, references, and context for one particular project. They are the primary source of truth for the AI assistant working on that project.
-   **Examples**:
    -   `context.md`: This is the main project document, generated by the `cinit` command from the `context_general.md` model.
    -   `DEVLOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` (optional, for larger projects): Project-specific logs, not to be confused with the ones in `cursor_configs`.
-   **How to Modify**:
    -   The `context.md` file is meant to be **freely edited and updated** throughout the lifecycle of your project.
    -   After `cinit` creates it, you should immediately open it to add more detail to the goal or include more specific references. As the project evolves, you can update it to reflect new requirements or decisions.
    -   These changes **do not** affect the original `context_general.md` model document.
